## Canonical Rules

### On conflicts between documents

* `Nexcellence\_Content\_v4.docx` is the canonical source for **all prices and payment plan amounts**. If any other document shows a different price, use v4.
* `NDA\_TechSpec.docx` is the canonical source for **all technical decisions**. Stack, schema, env vars, routing — defer to it.
* `NDA\_PageCopy.docx` is the canonical source for **all copy**. If layout and copy docs say different things, copy wins.

### On placeholder content

* All `buy.stripe.com/nexcellence-\*` links are **build-simulation placeholders**. Replace with live Stripe-generated URLs before go-live.
* All `yourwebsite.com/\*` links are placeholders for the real domain.
* Testimonials in `NDA\_Testimonials.docx` are **placeholder copy** — must be replaced with real verified client testimonials before launch.
* Founder credentials in `NDA\_FounderBio.docx` marked `\[BRACKET]` must be filled in by Dr. Triplett.
* Legal pages in `NDA\_LegalPolicies.docx` must be reviewed by a licensed attorney before publication.
* Stat bar on the homepage (200+ scholars, 94% completion rate, etc.) must be verified or removed before launch.
